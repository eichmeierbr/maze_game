# Learning to Code - Mars Game

This package is a simple game to learn programming in Python. The game consists of 3 level types
1. Maze: This is a traditional maze where the robot must get from the start to the finish. There are three maze files stored in mazes/ as .csv. The levels are easy, medium, and hard.
2. Mars: You are controlling the Mars rover and need to get into the base before a dust storm arrives. You know the map of the area and can navigate everywhere except a few craters.
3. Mars Action: This game is the same as the Mars game, but with a twist. There is a little martian running around that you need to save. You need to go to him, pick him up with an action, then return to base. (This game is still in development).

Programmers program the robot using the custom_robot function in main.py.
